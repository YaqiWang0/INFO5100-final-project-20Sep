This is use case 11 (team 5)!

If you want to run our code, run 'CustomerLogin'. Please use IntelliJ IDEA! Using eclipse may cause error.

Also, we contain three .jar in Package webDealer, you can click File->project structure->libraries->add(+), and you can compile them successfully!

The database contains two forms:

1.customer: webId id password
When you log in, you can use id:QIAN with password:123456 or id:CHENG with the same password.

2.dealer:webId id password
Also, When you log in, you can use id:xiang with password:12345 or id:jing with the same password.

Do not worry, though we use SQLite, you need not install any SQLite software if you do not want to change our database.

Just run it! If you have any problem about GUI, contact with Zimu Xu, for others, contact Jingru Xiang. Thanks!
